            " hey guys welcome back to my channel what is going to be the content of this video yes I finally cracked Google but this journey of mine was quite different from the generic Google interview experiences that you're used to seeing on YouTube so this journey with a lot of apps and flows ups and downs took me around one year right from the recruiter reaching out to me to me finally getting that offer and I'm going to share all that experience on my channel and I'm very sure it is going to help you guys a lot understanding the Google interview process as well as the current market situation that I started from last year so stick with me to the end and I'm very sure special if you want to interview for Google sometime soon this video will be very helpful for you [Applause] [Music] [Music] and then I cracked a couple of other companies two years later when I was switching and then Google happened so if someone in my college would have told me that one day I would be working for Amazon Google I would have said this is definitely not happening uh but yeah it happened uh and it has been a slow and gradual phase and a lot of things I have learned during the process but all I can say is uh you know don't think too much and just focus on Little Things try to achieve those little things and slowly you will take it from there so just before starting on my interview experience so throughout the video I would be using L3 and L photo ELC Matlab sd1 and L4 Matlab sd2 so in 2020 I interviewed for L3 that was the sd1 rule and uska experience when the last video may already share for a very close call but this time I got into Google for that sd2 that is L4 rule that is one level up the L3 so 2022 Amazon I was actually looking for a switch but I didn't want to interview for Google because just that the parameters are kind of more stricter in L4 experience just because of one bad interview she got uh L3 now I was not open to compromise on my compensation as well as my level uh just because of a brand like Google I mean Google is definitely a great company to work for but again these things are also priority for me I guess so as a result I was not replying much to the Google recruiters back then and I was like interviewing for other companies and I cracked a couple of offers for the sd2 role in Goldman Sachs Salesforce media.net Etc but as luck would have it uh around August uh September last year in 2022 Facebook laid off people and then there was this sudden hiring fees in the likes of Microsoft Uber Etc and Coffee started rounds clearly but suddenly things went downhill so the recruiter of these companies said that we have to haul this interview process and we are not sure when the hiring will resume uh it's totally based on market conditions and to top it all up I was not even getting any other opportunities from any other companies as well like things went completely silent uh Google recruiter and said whether you would be interested to you know interview with Google and I was like opportunities let's explore Google uh Google is obviously one of the great companies to work for and opportunities so I mean that's the only option I had right so recruiter asked me about my background and my tech stack interest and my location preference and all these things just a normal recruiter call that you have with any company confidence is basically a qualifier round for the onsite so in the phone screen round I got one question I solved it uh within 10 15 minutes and as a result I got follow-up question halaki full screen down my normally follow questions my three on-site interviews were to be scheduled uh since I was interviewing with Google Cloud so easily three technical interviews around so once my phone screen interviews were cleared Google recruiters reached out to me to schedule the three on-site rounds uh which was again going to be on data structures and algorithms so as I said the Google X Google specific preparations again it will be a topic for a separate video uh but uh so I wanted two weeks for the prep because beaches because of you know the environment and Durga pujas interview then I was not possible got around 17 18 days to prepare so all those three interviews were scheduled in one week and Tino interviews so I got positive feedback in each of these rounds and third and first round so I will be sharing my detailed interview experience round by round in some other videos so after these three Google interviews were done uh the Google recruiter reached out to me and said that you have your googliness round pending but we can't schedule it right now because we need an HM approval or an HM interest which is basically a hiring manager so Channel so the manager like me see and he reached out to my recruiter and said he I would like to move forward with this candidate so please complete his processary and I prepared not much I would say uh just said just one part of the day and then that round went also well and I got a positive feedback for that round now after my googliness round was over all I had to do was to wait for a manager to schedule the team fit call was almost like a hiring managerial down Japan experience questions you get multiple teams right to match right this was the only one opportunity that I had I tried to make full use of it luckily my manager liked me and he said that okay I am happy to move forward to this candidate so after that what happened was recruiter asked all of my education background uh professional experience grabbed all the interview experiences and sent everything to the hiring committee final decision whether I would be selected whether it be selected for L4 or else but from my side I was there so after my team fit around happened anyway so after one week the recruiter reached out to me called me up and he said here is this sorry for the delay but I just got the feedback from the hiring committee and it's positive so congratulations for getting that offer from Google and I'm like hey wait hang on is it L3 or L4 and he said no we are getting selected for L4 and then actually I I was happy because I said at the starting of the video in terms of level but yeah at the end it turned out to be great so then we had the offer discussion and all those things that generally happens in every other company and I jokingly uh told my recruiters that so we started uh last year August where you first reached out to me started this process and now we are almost August uh we're really completing the formalities the offer formalities so it's been almost a year and he laughed about it and I would really like to thank my recruiter because he has been super helpful throughout the process super transparent always helped me with the updates right and because you know when you are in the process for one year it's not that easy so big shout out to him and all the Google recruiters out there because even when I last interviewed the Google the recruiters were super super helpful and super super positive one of my friends I already talked about he really really helped me a lot you know guiding me throughout this process because you went into Google first so a huge huge you know heartfelt gratitude to him and also one my friends who is in meta he also motivated me a lot during interview process when I was interviewing you know we used to practice together and stuff because at that time he was also interviewing for Google so Google was the only company where actually I had a chance but at that time like things are very critical so yeah without these two people uh maybe I don't know uh where I would have been uh at least in terms of getting that offer from Google So yeah thank you so much and also thank you to you guys as well for supporting me throughout this journey uh it wouldn't have been possible without you guys as well so thanks thanks to you guys so yeah experience Google so the first thing is don't put any particular company on any pedestal be it Google or beat Amazon or be it any other Fan Company without even knowing coding they want to crack the likes of Google Amazon so don't do that uh your first thing your first aim should be your bet to be a better software engineer and also don't ever compromise on your level and compensation because they tend to prioritize the brand first and other than the experience the type of work right and the type of role that they get so you will have ample opportunities in the future to crack these type of companies and the second thing is uh Brands be important Roti especially for people who are not from good colleges because brand gives you that credibility and many Amazon the kind of opportunities I got it kind of showed that brand really helps especially if you're not from a good college these are the only good companies so that is not the case the truth somewhere lies in between especially I feel if you're not from a good college or from a taxi College also never undermine yourself and don't think that you can't crack any particular company this is of tea but as I went to the interview process I understood that this is something I can do so don't get intimidated and think you can't do the stuff just start doing just try to become a good software engineer and later on you will figure out uh things as you go uh so I was also in a similar position as as you and my first year I couldn't do matrix multiplication code as well so from that that Journey I've seen it kind of a lot of things so what I would suggest is keep on doing whatever you're doing try to get better at things slowly and steadily you will get that and don't just you know think that I have to crack only one particular set of companies and instead try to be a better software engineer and yeah that's it for the video I hope this was insightful as well as inspirational to a lot of other people who come from similar backgrounds as a mind similar colleges of mine and I in this video here I would come up with the interview experience of Google as well as how I prepared for the same if you want to know about it let me know down in comments and I will be more than happy to make a video on it also I would be coming up with the Java tutorial videos very soon I was really occupied with a lot of things happening in my life so that's why I couldn't come up I hope you would understand and see you soon in the next video thank you [Music]\n"
